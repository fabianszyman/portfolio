  about: `I am Fabian, a Product Manager based in Munich with more than 5 years of working experience in the industry. In my spare time, I am interested in exploring new technologies, particularly in the areas of crypto, programming, and Web3. 
  
  While I being in charge of numerous IT-projects covering Front-End, Back-End and Native Apps, I recently developed a strong interesed in Crypto, NFT and Blockchain technology.

  As a Product Manager, I’ve always been interested in staying up to date with the latest and greatest technologies. However, I’ve never had the desire or time to dive deep into coding. That’s why I’ve decided to start this blog called nft-hypebeast.com to document my progress as I learn how to code and explore the world of Crypto, NFTs and Blockchain.
